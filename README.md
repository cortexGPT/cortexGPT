## Cortex Project - README

### Overview
Cortex is a sophisticated, locally-hosted chatbot project focused on natural language processing (NLP), context management, and multimodal capabilities. Cortex aims to provide a rich, personalized interaction experience by combining advanced NLP with integration to personal applications and offline operation.

### Version: `v0.0.0.1`
This release includes the initial project setup and environment configuration, with basic dependency management, unit testing setup, and a simple directory structure in place.

---

### Features in v0.0.0.1:
- **Project Setup**: Fully configured development environment.
- **Dependency Management**: Using `pip` to install required dependencies.
- **Basic Project Structure**: Includes organized source code, tests, and documentation folders.
- **Code Formatting and Linting**: Pre-commit hooks with `pylint` and `black` are configured for consistent code quality.
- **Unit Testing Setup**: Basic unit tests using `pytest` for initial environment validation.

---

### Prerequisites

To set up and run the project locally, you will need the following installed on your machine:
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Python package installer

---

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cortexGPT/cortexGPT.git
   cd cortexGPT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   After installing the dependencies, you can verify that everything is set up correctly by running the basic tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_environment.py
   ```

---

### Usage

Cortex v0.0.0.1 primarily focuses on the project setup. Here are some useful commands for managing the development environment:

- **Running Linter and Formatter**:
  Before committing any changes, you can manually run `pylint` and `black` to ensure your code follows the correct formatting and linting rules.
  ```bash
  pylint src/  # Check code linting
  black src/   # Automatically format the code
  ```

- **Running Unit Tests**:
  To ensure that everything works as expected, run the unit tests using `pytest`:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **Pre-Commit Hooks**:
  Pre-commit hooks are configured to automatically check for linting and formatting issues before any commit. Ensure `pre-commit` is installed:
  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

  Now, every time you commit, the hooks will run and check your code for any issues.

### Examples

#### Dependency Installation Example
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can test the installation:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command installs all the necessary Python packages.

#### Running Tests
After installing dependencies, you can run tests to verify the environment:
```bash
pytest tests/test_environment.py
```

This will check that dependencies are installed correctly and the environment is set up properly.

### Contribution Guidelines

To contribute to Cortex, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. **Write Code**: Make your changes, following the coding standards outlined below.
4. **Test**: Ensure your code passes all tests and follows the linting/formatting guidelines.
5. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you're ready, create a pull request, describing your changes.

---

### Coding Standards

- **Python Version**: Use Python 3.8 or higher.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **Variables/Functions**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `fetch_user_data`).
  - **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserManager`).
- **Branching**: Follow the `feature/<feature-name>` convention for new branches.
- **Linting and Formatting**: All code must pass linting (`pylint`) and formatting (`black`) checks before being committed.

---

### Troubleshooting

1. **Dependencies Not Installing**:
   If you face any issues with dependency installation, ensure that `pip` is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Tests Failing**:
   If tests fail, double-check the Python and `pip` versions. Also, ensure the project directory structure is as described above.

3. **Pre-Commit Hooks Not Running**:
   If the hooks don’t run as expected, re-install them:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
