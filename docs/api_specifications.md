# **API Specifications - Cortex v0.0.0.1**

---

## **Version Overview**
This version of Cortex focuses on setting up the basic project infrastructure. The API at this stage is minimal, providing basic interaction endpoints for a future Flask-based backend. Below is a detailed specification for the endpoints and expected behaviors.

### **Base URL**
The API will be hosted locally during development. The base URL for all endpoints is:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

---

## **Endpoints**

### **1. `/` (GET)**
- **Description**: This endpoint serves as a health check to ensure the server is running.
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response**:
  - **Status**: `200 OK`
  - **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "Server is running"
    }
    ```
- **Error Handling**:
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: If the server encounters an issue while responding.

---

### **2. `/echo` (POST)**
- **Description**: This endpoint echoes the data sent by the client, demonstrating basic request handling. In the future, this will serve as a foundation for more complex processing.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request**:
  - **Body (JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "string"
    }
    ```
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello Cortex"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
  - **Status**: `200 OK`
  - **Body (JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
      "echo": "Hello Cortex"
    }
    ```
- **Error Handling**:
  - **400 Bad Request**: If the request body is invalid or missing.
    - **Response**:
      ```json
      {
        "error": "Invalid input"
      }
      ```
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: If the server encounters an issue while processing the request.

## **Error Handling Strategy**

All API responses will follow a standard format for errors to ensure consistent feedback to the client. The following error responses are supported:

### **1. 400 Bad Request**
- **Description**: The client has sent a malformed request.
- **Example**:
  - **Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "msg": "Hello"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid input"
    }
    ```

### **2. 500 Internal Server Error**
- **Description**: A server error occurred. This could be due to various internal issues.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Server encountered an issue"
  }
  ```

---

## **Input/Output Formats**

### **Input Format**
- All API endpoints expect input data to be in **JSON** format. Invalid or missing JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` error.
- For `POST` requests, ensure the correct `Content-Type` header is set:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```

### **Output Format**
- All responses from the API will be returned in **JSON** format with the following headers:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```

---

## **Known Issues**
- The current version has limited error handling and does not yet implement security measures such as rate limiting or input validation beyond simple checks.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
As the project evolves, the following improvements are planned for the API:
- **Input Validation**: Add stricter validation for incoming requests using validation libraries.
- **Authorization**: Implement token-based authentication.
- **Session Handling**: Add support for user sessions and contextual data.
- **Error Reporting**: Provide more detailed error messages with stack traces during development.

---

This document will be updated in future revisions as new features are added and existing functionality is improved.

---

### Next Steps:
1. **Implement `/api/data` endpoint**: For handling more complex POST requests.
2. **Integrate Flask-RESTful**: For better endpoint management and routing.
